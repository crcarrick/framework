## Features to copy

```
- Routing    -- Slots
- Routing    -- Route Groups (shared layouts)
- ‚úÖ Routing -- Route metadata (‚úÖ but still need to add many fields)
- ‚úÖ Bundle  -- Bundle route components (page, layout, fallback) together
- ‚úÖ Routing -- Nested layouts
- Rendering  -- __SSP appearing in <head> (maybe ok?)
- Server     -- Can we support RSC?
- Server     -- SSR / Suspense stuff is (less, but still) pretty shitty atm
- Bundle     -- There is a problem where if you export something (metadata, gSSP, etc) from both
                a page, _and_ a layout or fallback, they all stop working
- Bundle     -- For now, the project installing `metaframework` still has to install a ton of peer deps
